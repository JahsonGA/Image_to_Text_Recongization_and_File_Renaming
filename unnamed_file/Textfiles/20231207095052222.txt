There's no bigger waste than wasted
effort.
OF the $27 billion spent last year for
résearch and development, an estimated
50 per cent was wasted
because of duplication.
_ This appraisal comes
from the Pennsylvania
JFechnical Assistance
“Program Network
(PENNTAP).
One of PENNTAP’s
eomplainis is that it
isn’t tapped often
. enough by Pennsylvania
; businessmen.
WYLIE “Td like to say we're
a household word but we’re not,” said
Dr. Roy Marlow who runs PENNTAP
from: its office at Pennsylvania State
University.

Although the infortiation network has
beet in operation for five years, it
remains a sttawser to the people who
need it most — small businessmen.

Even so, the state - financed agency
has piled up a number of successes. .

A Connellsville foundry got a sand-
easting lesson. from PENNTAP. It esti-
mates the annual saving at $44,000,

About: to make a $1,000 study, a
plastics manufacturer was. advised that
the same study had already been done,

And there was: the textile machinery
firm in Reading that was frequently
troubled by failure of a $30 part. PENN-
TAP provided an article showing a
hetter way to harden the metal part. The
last part failure was more than two.
years ago.

Here’s how PENNTAP works:

Somebody needing assistance can call

cation offices.

one of PENNTAP’s four full-time field
specialists. He contacts: the caller and
decides where to go for the answers.

Actually Pennsylvania abounds with
wisdom. There are at least {46 institu-
tions bulging with technical knowledge.

“As far as I kiiow we are the only
state in the nation with @ technology
delivery system like this,’ Marlow. said.

This year PENNTAP’s budget: is
$247,000. Marlow believes the agency
generates savings two to three times that
much.

Business isn’t the only target for
PENNTAP, Local governments, schools,
hospitals and nursing hones are candi-
dates for the agency’s services.

happy.
