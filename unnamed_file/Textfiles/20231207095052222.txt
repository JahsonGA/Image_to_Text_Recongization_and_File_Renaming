Business &

Despite Savings

By WILLIAM H. WYLIE

There's no bigger waste than wasted
effort.

Of the $27 billion spent last year for
research and development, an estimated
50 per cent was wasted
because of duplication.

This appraisal comes
from the Pennsylvania
Technical Assistance
‘Program Network

(PENNTAP).

One of PENNTAP’s
complaints is that it
isn’t tapped often
enough by Pennsylvania

: businessmen.

WYLIE “I'd like to say we're
a household word but we're not," said
Dr. Roy Marlow who runs PENNTAP
from its office at Pennsylvania State
University.

Although the information network has
been in operation for five years, it
remains a stranger to the people who
need it most — small businessmen.

Even so, the state - financed agency
has piled up a number of successes.

A Connellsville foundry got a sand-
easting lesson from PENNTAP. It esti-
mates the annual saving at $44,000.

About to make a $1,000 study, a
plastics manufacturer was advised that
the same study had already been done.

And there was the textile machinery
firm in Reading that was frequently
troubled by failure of a $30 part. PENN-
TAP provided an article showing a
better way to harden the metal part. The
last part failure was more than two
years ago.

Here’s how PENNTAP works:

Somebody needing assistance can call
one of Penn State’s 23 Continuing Edu-
cation offices.

To Business

one of PENNTAP's four full-time field
specialists. He contacts the caller and
decides where to go for the answers.

Actually Pennsylvania abounds with
wisdom. There are at least 146 institu-
tions bulging with technical knowledge.

“As far as I know we are the only
state in the nation with a technology
delivery system like this,” Marlow said.

This year PENNTAP’s budget is
$247,000. Marlow believes the agency
Benerates savings two to three times that
much.

Business isn’t the only target for
PENNTAP. Local governments, schools,
hospitals and nursing homes are candi-
dates for the agency's services.

If people would just ring PENNTAP’s .

phone more often, Marlow would be
happy.
