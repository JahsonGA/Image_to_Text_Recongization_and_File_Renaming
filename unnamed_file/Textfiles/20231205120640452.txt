UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — A choice
of subjects ranging from motorcycle
safety education to fir tree planting
helped boost enrollments in Continuing
Education programs at The Penn-
sylvania State University last year.

There ‘were 133,327 students working,
at 290 different locations, a gain of 8,083
students and 25 locales over 1970-71,
according to Floyd B. Fischer, yice
president for continuing education at the
University.

A total of 5,232 persons seryed as in-
structors for the programs with 1,167 of
these being from the faculty of the Uni-
versity and the balance coming from’
industry, business, government and
other schools and colleges. The largest
number of students — 25,575 — were en-
rolled in programs held at University
Park. Other Penn State campuses with
particularly large enrollments included
Altoona, 11,295; Ogontz, 7,775;
Delaware, 7,254; and McKeesport, 6,748.

Motorcycle education was one of the
more unusual courses sponsored by
Continuing Education last year in an
effort to improve operational safety. A
credit course featuring both classroom
and laboratory work was developed for
driver training teachers.

The “fir tree’ program brought '
groups of prisoners from the Rockview
Correctional Institution on field trips to
University Park to help prepare them
for positions with landscape con-
tractors, the nursery industry and
garden centers.

On the other side of the law, some 330
cadets from the State Police Academy in
Hershey enrolled in University credit
courses to work toward their bac-

calaureate degrees and a law en-
forcement corrections certificate.

Continuing education specialists also
ran a program which trained 60 adult
welfare recipients, all of whom had de-
pendent children, as teacher aides in
Pittsburgh area schools which had
pledged them employment. They again
sponsored training at Elders Ridge in
Indiana County for under- and un-
employed individuals in the operation of
mine and heavy equipment. This
Program has already graduated nearly
300 persons who are now earning bet-
ween $8,000 and $14,000 a year.

Through its Pennsylvania Technical
Assistance Program (PENNTAP), Con-
linuing Education supplies technical in-
formation to businesses, schools, and
government to improve their
operations. In one case last year,
PENNTAP helped a plastics company
change production methods and reduced
a 40-hour process to five minutes:

Another highly praised service last
year was undertaken with the Penn
sylvania Heart Association. A coronary
heart risk screening program processec
3,776 people in four central Penn-
sylvania counties. Participants with
high-risk factors were alerted to théir
problem and encouraged to take
corrective action.

Other unusual programs promoted
effective teaching in church sabbath
schools; informed the residents of Berks
County on such community issues as
educationa, government, health, safet
and ecology; and in the wake of Hat.
