This creates the phenomenon that the sci-

time which lapses between the devel-
bi -opment of a new technology and its appli-

desire to bring about a better way ‘of life |
for Pennsylvania citizens through ‘the ap- —
plication of technology to.problems of en- —
vironmental pollution, transportation, and ©
occupaticnal safety.

This program, sponsored by the Penn-

sylvania Department of Commerce and. -
. administered as a Continuing Education
- Program of The Pennsylvania State Uni-—

versity, consists of a number of special
projects to assist in the acquisition, deliv-
ery, and application of technical informa-
tion. Included among these is a library in-
formation system to provide PENNTAP
users with published and existent informa-
tion on technolo gical problems.

This system utilizes the service of a full-
time librarian to conduct the literary

search for relevant information on specif- . -
ic technical questions. The ‘“‘Sound of |.

Progress’ radio broadcasts represent an-
other attempt to create a greater aware-
ness of technological advances soon after
they are made. In addition, PENNTAP
conducts selected workshops and short

courses to disseminate new technological ©
methods to groups «

widivid-ials having a
common interest inspecific technical pro- ©.
cesses. Finally, and perhaps most impor- _
tant is the presence of three full-time tech-

nically qualified field specialists, all of |
-whom are faculty members of The Penn- _
_ sylvania State University, whose taskitis |

to assist the user of the PENNTAP ser-
vices in defining and solving his problems.
In the past, an organization with a tech-

-nical problem could contact various sup-

pliers, investigate the problems them-. -
Selves, or hire someone to locate the desir-
ed information. By calling in PENNTAP,. :
it is now possible for the user to have infor-
mation gleaned from literally billions of

pages of technical articles, journal,
