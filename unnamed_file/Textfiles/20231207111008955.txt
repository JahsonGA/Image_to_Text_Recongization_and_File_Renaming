This program, sponsored by the Penn-
sylvania Department of Commerce and |‘
_ administered as a Continuing Education
Program of The Pennsylvania State Uni-

versity, consists of a number of special

projects to assist in the acquisition, deliv-
ery, and application of technical informa-

tion. Included among these is a library in-
formation system to provide PENNTAP

users with published and existent informa-—

tion on technolo gical problems.

This system utilizes the service of a full- .

time librarian to conduct the literary

ness of technological advances soon after
they are made. In addition, PENNTAP

‘conducts selected workshops and short
courses to disseminate new technological | —
widividials having a

methods to groupe o-

- search for relevant information on specif- |

ic technical questions. The ‘‘Sound of . | ~

tant is the presence of three full-time tech- —

nically qualified field specialists, all of |.
-whom are faculty members of The Penn- __

- sylvania State University, whose task itis
to assist the user of the PENNTAP sser-

vices in defining and solving his problems. —

In the past, an organization witha tech- —

‘nical problem could contact various sup- —
pliers, investigate the problems them-.
selves, or hire someone to locate the desir-

ed information. By calling in PENNTAP,,

it is now possible for the user to have infor-—

mation gleaned from literally billions of

pages of technical articles, journal, re-—
ports, and research data placed at his Sais. |
