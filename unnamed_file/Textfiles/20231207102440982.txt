way to make more of these
findings relevant.

According to Shapp, a gradu-
ate of Case Institute in Ohio,
there are three things specific.
ally that have not been done:

' — Government has not suf:
ficiently used the findings of
science and the new technology
fo stimulate growth in the pri-
vate sector. .

— The wonders of modern

_ Science have not been brought
to bear upon the pressing hu-
man problems of the times.

— There has been no success
in integretating scientific and
technological knowledge into
the policy-making aparatus of
government at operational lev-
els.

“Each of these areas cries
out for the massive application
of modern knowledge. The
knowledge is there and the
means to apply it are at ou
command,” he said. :

He noted that as spinoffs of
the space programs, the nation

has developed better weather’

reporting, new insulation mate-
rials, the use of smaller cam-
puters and more medical
knowledge and equipment.
Shapp said such development
must continue and that govern-
ment delivery of these services
must be efficient and econom-

ical. “But bureaucracy of gov-
ernment is stil in many ways,

“back in the quill pen era,” he

added.

The . question, Shapp ex-
Plained, is not which level of
govenment needs help the most
but whether or not we are will-
ing to place technical advice
and assistance on the same lev-
el of importance that we alford
to political and bureaucratic
Opinion.

“These are questions you
must answer at this confer-
ence,” he told the 250 scien-
tists, government leaders,
educators and industrial Tepre-
sentatives ass@mbled’ for the
convention.

“You have labled this an ‘ac-
tton’ conference. The theme of
my message in not only one of
tion’ conference. The theme of
concluded.

Following Shapp's address,
Dr. Edward E. David Jr., sci-
ence advisor to the President
and director of the White
House Office of Science -and
Technology, told the confer-
ence that technological and sci-
entitic sharing must be worked
out to augment revenue shar-
ing.

David emphasized the need
for the local governments to
build up their. technological

and scientific understanding
and know-how in order to be
able to use the developments
Reing churned out at univer-
Sities and research projects.

He claimed that even when
developments are made, the
lack of talent at local levels
renders the findings useless
and irrelevant ¢o these commu-
nities. “Such problems cannot
be solved by more federal leg-
islation and finding alone,” he
said.

David, who is teaving today
for the USSR to head a delega-
tion to begin formal implemen-
tation of the Moscow accords
on science and technology, of-
fered three aids in providing
better understanding at loca!
levels.

According to the former ex-
ecutive director of research of
Bell Telephone Labs, there
should be more commu-
nications among governments,
More access to federal re-
sources and an exploration of
Ways to create better commu-
nication between local govern-
ments, industries, schools and
market technology so real
needs canbe met.

David pointed out that since _

World War II, science and
technology had deen geared to
meet only federal needs, espe-

cially in defense and space ex-
ploration.

“Now we have the ticklish
problem of technological trans-
fer," David said. He said that
with the shift from a defense
and space dominated research
to a domestic age in which the
consumer will be the final
judge of the research, there .
will be many problems in tran-
sition, _ ,

“The federal government is
no longer its own consumer
and producer,” he said. The
citizen, too, will also have to :
look at things differently, he
added.

‘David reported that since °
1969, the federal government
has increased its domestic
spending by 65 per cent and
that in-tiscal 1973, $43.8 billion
of the federal budget will be
spent on aid to local and state
governments,

David predicted some prog-
ress would become evident
soon in the areas of pollution,
transportation and energy but
that locat ievel training will
make it all useful to the aver-
age citizen.

In his closing temarks, Da-
vid said: “This is the time for
action. What should we do? 1
hope you will not say we should
make more reports."*
