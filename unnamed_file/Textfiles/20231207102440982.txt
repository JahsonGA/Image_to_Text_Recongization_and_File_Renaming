way to make more of these
findings relevant.

According to Shapp; a gradu- ~
até of Case Institute in Ohio, -

there are three things specific:
ally that have not beer done:
"= Government has not suf

"to bear upon the pressing. hu-
man problems: of the times.

= There has been tio success
in integretating scientific and
technological knowledge into
the. policy-making aparatus of
government at operational lev-
els.

“Bach of these. areas cries
out for the massive application
of modern knowledge. The
knowledge is there and the
means to apply it are at our
command,” he said. .

He noted that as spinoffs of
the space programs, the nation
has developed better weather
reporting, new insulation mate-
rials, the use of smaller com-
puters and more medical
Rnowledge and equipment.

Shapp said such development
must continue atid that govern-
ment delivery of these services
must be efficient and: econom:

ical. “But bureaucracy of gov
ernment is still in many ways,
back in the quill pen era,” he
added.

The . question, _Shapp ex-
plained, is not which level of
govenment needs help. the most
but whether or not we ate will-
ing to place technical advice
and assistance on the same lev-
él of importance that we afford
to: political and bureaucratic
opinion, .

“These are questions you

Following Shapp’s address,
Dr. Edward E. David Jr, sci-
ence advisor to. the President
and director of the White
House Office of Science ~and
Technology, told the confer-
ence that technological and sci-
entitic sharing must be worked
out to augment revenue shar-
ing.

sities and research: projects.

He claimed that even when
developments are made, the
lack of talent at local tevels
renders the findings useless
and irrelevant to these commu-
nities. “Such problenis cannot
be solved by more federa leg-
islation and finding alone,” he
said.

David, who: is leaving today

tion to begin formal implemen:
tation of the Moscow accords
on Science and technology, of-
fered three aids in providing
better understanding at local
levels.

David pointed out that since
World War II, science and
technology had been geared to
meet only federal needs, espe-
