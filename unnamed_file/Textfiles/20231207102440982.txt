way fo. make: more’ of these
findings‘ relevant,

According to: Shapp, a gradu
ate of Case Institute: in Ohio;

there are three things specific-
ally that have not been: done:

— Government ‘has. not suf:
: ciently used: the: findings af
Science and the new: technology
fo stimulate growth in. the pri
vate sector,

~~ The: wonders: of modern
_ science’ have. not been’ brought
‘to. bear upon. the pressing hie
man problems of the:timés:

— There has been’ no success
in. integretating. scientific “and
technological: knowledge into

the ‘policy-making. aparatug ‘of:

-governinent: at: operational lev-
els.

“Each. of’ these: areas: cries
out for: the massive application
of modern: knowledge.’ The
knowledge is’ there “and’ ‘the
means :to- apply tare at” our
command,”? he’ said.

He: noted ‘that: as spinotts of
the space programs, the nation
has:‘developed’ better weather
reporting, new insulation: mate-
tials, the: use -of smaller: com-
puters and: more.: medical
Rnowledge and equipment:

Shapp said such development
must continue: and that govern:

ment delivery of these: services.

must be efficient and économ-

ical. “But bureaucracy of gov-
ernment is still in many ways;
back in the quill pen: era,” he
added.

The... question; _Shapp ex:
plained, is: not which level:-of
govenment needs help: the most
but whether or not we are will:
ing to. place technical advice
and assistance on the same lev:
el of importance that we afford
to. “political. and: bureaucratic
opinion. ;

“These are. questions. you
must: answer: ‘at: this:confer=
ence,” he told: the 250. 'scien-
tists.: government leaders,
educators and. Uidustrial repre-
séntatives assembled: forthe
convertion.

“You have labled this ‘an ‘ac-
tton’ ‘conferéncé. The theme: of

Following Shapp’s address,
Dr. Edward E. David Jr.) sci:
ence advisor to the President

House: Office: of Science:-and
Technology, told: “the ~confér-

David. emphasized: the ‘need
for: the local: governments to
build up their techtiological

and.-scientifi¢ understanding
and ‘know-how in order to be
able ‘to use the developments
being churned out ‘at univer:
sities: and research projects.
He. claimed. that even when
developments are made, the
lack -of talent at local” levels
renders the findings. “useless
and: irrelevant to these commu-
nities. ‘Such’ problems’ cannot
be solved by more federa leg-
islation and: finding alone,” he
said.
David, who is leaving: today
for the USSR to head a delega-

David pointed: out:-that: since

cially in defense and Space ex-
ploration. :

“Now. we have. the ticklish
problem of technological trans-
fer,” David said. He said that
with the ‘shift from a defense

consumer. will: be. the © tinal
Judge of ‘the research, "there.
will be many. problems i in tran:
sition:

‘The federal government: is
no-clonger. its: own: consumer
and. producer,’ he ‘said: The
Citizen, too, will-also have. to :
look: at: things differently, ‘he
added,

David reported. that. since: :
1969;° the’ federal Bavernment
has increased its’. domestié
spending by. 65- per: cent and
that. in fiscal 1973, $43.8: billion
ofthe federal budget will be

David: predicted: some prog-
ress. .wotild: become. evident
soon in the areas of pollution,

that. local: level training. will
make it all useful to the aver

In his closing ‘remarks, Da-
“This: is the time for
action. What should ‘we: do? 1
hope you will not say we should
make more reports.”
