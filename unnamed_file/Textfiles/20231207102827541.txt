One project under the auspices of PENNTAP is the Library Information
Service which locates published literature on prior research. If
literature on prior research can not be found, the inquiring group
will be directed to other possible sources of information. The
Library Information Service does not conduct or sponsor original
research. Another project, MAP-PENNTAP (Materials Advisory Panel)
offers one-day seminars and short courses to Pennsylvania industrial
personnel with a B.S. degree or its equivalent in training and experi-
ence. These free sessions are conducted by faculty members of six
Pennsylvania universities with the purpose of stimleting and informing
practicing industrial engineers and scientists about new materials
technology and economics. A third project available through Penn State
is Small Industries Research (SIR). For companies located in
Pennsylvania with less than 1,500 employees and an annual sales
volume of less than $50 million, SIR arranges discussion between the
academic commmity and industry, and provides matching fund grants
to finance research and development. The results of the research
are available to all interested companies.

Although little training in industrial services has been given to
Pennsylvania ERR's, industrial problems are occasionally recognized
by local office personnel. Thus, it is valuable to a local office to
know where to turn for an answer. Further information on PENNTAP
can be obtained by contacting any of the twenty-three Pennsylvania
State University offices throughout the Commonwealth. The Employer
Relations Section in the State Office should be notified of any

successes through PENNTAP action.
