PENNTAP Offers Free Technical Information

Pennsylvania has had a working state-wide
information dissemination network for sev-
eral years. The network — Pennsylvania
Technical Assistance Program (PENNTAP)
— is part of a technology application effort
coordinated by the state Department of
Commerce’s Office of Science and Tech-
nology. Other elements of the system are the
Governor’s Science Advisory Committee
(GSAC), which identifies new technology
useful to the state, and the Pennsylvania
Science and Engineering Foundation (PS-
EF), which funds research critical to the
state’s future. PENNTAP is funded by the
state, the National Science Foundation and

| Penn State. It is administered by the Penn

State Continuing Education program, with

Dr. H. Leroy Marlow as Director.

The service’s first premise is that “the
mere availability of technical information
does not insure its use.” Small businessmen
and municipal officials are often too busy to
keep up with the rapidly growing volume of
information. As a result some research results
never reach those who need them. Moreover,
some money may be wasted in needless du-
plication of research because there is no easy
way of knowing what has already been done.

Time Lag

PENNTAP is designed to transmit up-to-
date information to industries, local govern-
ments, community organizations and. others
with specific technical problems. According
to Mr. Floyd Fischer, Penn State’s Vice
President for Continuing Education, “our
whole effort is geared toward shortening the
time lag between a research breakthrough

and its practical application.” Fischer says
the program is unique among the states.

Field Specialists

Those seeking help from the service may
call any of Penn State’s Continuing Educa-
tion offices across the state. The problem ‘is
referred to one of PENNTAP’s four fulltime
field specialists. As members of academic
departments, these specialists can both
answer questions in their own disciplines
and put other questions in technical form.
The specialist determines where to go for an
answer if he does not already know it. Ac-
cording to Marlow, there are about 146 in-
stitutions across the state which can provide
all the technical knowledge that can be
found. He says “we're tied to universities,

libraries, private Jaboratdries, companies —
atl the Federal and state, private and public
sources. There may be a font of knowledge
that we don’t know about, but Pd definitely
say that we're close to 160 per cent.”

If the problem is very complex, the ques-
tioner may be tred to another informa-
tion source, PENNTAP directors point out
that the service does not compete with
professional consulting engineering firms.
Fischer says that “we operate on a rule of
thunb thai if it takes more than four or five
hours, it’s beyond us.” Ta cases where te

Free Services

Whatever the outcome of the information
search, PFENNTAP’s services are free. Capy-
ing aud other charges may be ineurred in

securing information from other institutions,
but, the questioner is always consulted be-
fore any financial committment is made,

Penn State officials are very optimistic
about PENNTA?’s fone. Fischer claims
that the state’s $160,000 investment has
gs of $961,600 so
far this year for various industries. He says
state legislators are pleased and have indi-
cated they will probably double the state’s
contribution.

Fischer wants to use the money to hire
field specialists in more disciplines sinee he
loclieves they have been crucial to PENN-
TAP’s success. “We have found that the
amount of information transferred is directly
proportional to the arnount of person-fo-per-
son contact.” (PENNTAP also distributes
information through conferences and a five-
day-asveek radio program “The
Sound of Progress.” ) In cooperation with the
Institute he will be employing a professional
