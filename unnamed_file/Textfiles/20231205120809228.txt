PENNTAP Offers Free Technical Information

Pennsy!vania has had a working state-wide
information dissemination network for sev-
eral years. The network — Pennsylvania
Technical Assistance Program (PENNT AP)

| — is part of a technology application effort

coordinated by the state Department of
Commerce's Office of Science and Tech-
nology. Other elements of the system are the
Governor’s Science Advisory Committee
(GSAC), which identifies new technology
useful to the state, and the Pennsylvania
Science and Engineering Foundation (PS-
EF), which funds research critical to the
state’s future. PENNTAP is funded by the
state, the National Science Foundation and

| Penn State. It is administered by the Penn
! State Continuing Education program, with
. Dr. H. Leroy Marlow as Director.

The service's first premise is that “the
mere availability of technical information
does not insure its use.” Small businessmen
and municipal officials are often too busy to
keep up with the rapidly growing volume of
information. As a result some research results
never reach those who need them. Moreover,
some money may be wasted in needless du-
plication of research because there is no easy
way of knowing what has already been done.

Time Lag

PENNTAP is designed to transmit up-to-
date information to industries, local govern-
ments, community organizations and others
with specific technical problems. According
to Mr. Floyd Fischer, Penn State’s Vice
President for Continuing Education, “our
whole effort is geared toward shortening the
time lag between a research breakthrough

and its practical application.” Fischer says
the program is unique among the states.
Field Specialists
Those seeking help from the service may

- call any of Penn State’s Continuing Educa-

tion offices across the state. The problem is
referred to one of PENNTAP’s four fulltime
field specialists. As members of academic
departments, these specialists can both
answer questions in their own disciplines
and put other questions in technical form.
The specialist determines where to go for an
answer if he does not already know it. Ac-
cording to Marlow, there are about 146 in-
stitutions across the state which can provide
all the technical knowledge that can be
found. He says “we're tied to universities,

libraries, private Jaboratories, companies —
ail the Federal and state, private and public
sources, There may be a font of knowledge
that we don’t imow absut, but I'd definitely
say that we're close to 100 per cent.”

If the problem is very complex, the ques-
tioner may be seferred to another informa-
tion source. PENNTAP directors point out
that the service docs nat compele with
professional cousulting engincering _ firms,
Fischer says that “we operate on « rule of
thunb that if it takes more than fouc or five
hours, it’s beyond us.” Ia cases where tech-
nology to solve a problem: docs not exist
TENNTAP mas suggest that the questioner
contract for the necessary research.

Free Services

Whatever the outcome of the information
search, PENNTAP's services are free. Copy-
ing aud other charges may be incurred in

securing information from other ixstitutions,
but the questioner is always consulted be-
fore any financial committment is made.

Penn State officials are very optimistic
about PENNTAP's fonue. Fischer claims
that the state's $100,000 investment has
achieved documented savings of $961,000 so
far this ycar for various industries. Ile says
state legislators are pleased and have indi-
cated they will probably double the state’s
contribution.

Fischer wants to use the money to hire
ficld specialists in more disciplines since he
lelieves they have been cracial to PENN-
TAP’s success. “We have found that the
amonnt of information transferred is directly
proportional to the amount of person-to-per-
son contact.” (PENNTAP also distributes
infonmation through conferences and a five-
day-a.weck radio program called “The
Sound of Progress.” In cooperation with the
Tastitute he will be employing a professional
in the water resources ficld.
