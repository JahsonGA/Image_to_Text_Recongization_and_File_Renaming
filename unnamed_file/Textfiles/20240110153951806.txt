Making Pennsylvania a better
place to ilve and work by apply-
Ing existing technology to serve
the community, the Common-
wealth, and Industry is the new
thrust of the Pennsytvania Tech-

“nical Assistance Program.

PENNTAP, according to Its di-
rector, Dr. H. LeRoy Marfow, was
begun five years ago with service
to Industry as its primary goal,
and with prospective “clients”
referred to various Institutions of
higher leaming, libraries, and
other facllitles for the information
they sought.

“Now,” Dr. Marlow explalned,
“PENNTAP has established a
statewlde, non-overlapping tech-
nical Information network to assist
In the transfer and application
of scientific technical information
to municipalities, industries, health
agencies, governmental organiza-
tions, and others.” PBNNTAPie<
sponsored by the Pennsylvania
Department of Commerce atid’ad-
ministered as a continuing educe-
tlon program of Peni Sfate.

Acquisition, Interpretation, and
transfer of problem-solving date
will be accomplished by several
full-time, technically qualified

members of the Penn State fac-
ulty. Through this program, facts
gleaned from Ilteralty billions of
pages of technical information
and research data will be placed,
free of charge, at the user's dis-
posal, providing possible solu-
tlons to existing problems, Dr.
Marlow sald.

An example of the type of social
and economic benefit that could
be derived through the new sys-
tem would be to correct an in-
dustrial plant’s discharge of pol
lutants. PENNTAP, through exist-
Ing knowledge, could provide iIn-
formation to correct the situation,
thus solving the Industry's prob-
lem and at the same time helping
to improve the community's en-
vironment.

“The philosophy behind this
network Is eat: no tenner wilt be

stuck"on | OE Mer Mar-
tw said, oi
which’ ate 6utiide the ” seal of
PENNTAP will be referred to an
organization or individual who Is
able to provide the neded help,
either from existing public
sources or professional consul-
tants. Only rarely, and very re-
luctantly, will we be forced to
reply to anyone, ‘we can't help
you.'”

To recelve technical Informa-
tlon, a client requests PENNTAP
services through any of the 23
Penn State Continuing Education
district offices throughout the
Commonwealth. Upon recelving
an Inquiry about PENNTAP serv-
Ices, the district office will secure
the Individual’s name, address,
and telephone number, and as-
sure him that his Inquiry will re-
celve prompt attention.

The .office recetving the Inquiry
will Immediately forward {t to the
PENNTAP office at University
Park Campus where lt will be
processed by the staff.

A member of the PENNTAP
organization will contact the In-
quirer, determine the nature of
the problem, and direct It to an
existing unit which- can most
readily handle the problem, The
response, for example, might con-
sist of printed technical Informa-
flon In response to a specific
question, It might be a referral
+> a consultant, manufacturer, or
vtate agency, or it might require
1 visit by one of the technical
feld specialists.

Penn State, under the provisions
of the Morrill Land-Grant Act of
1862, Is required ". . . to promote
the liberal and practical educa-
tion of the industrial classes in
the several pursuits and profes-
sions of life.”

“This new program follows the
Intent of the Land-Grant Act in
that it states emphatically that
technical assistance Is available
to anyone, regardiess of where
he lives in the Commonweatth,
simply by asking for it,” Dr. Mar-
low sald.
