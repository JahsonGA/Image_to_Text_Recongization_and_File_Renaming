Penn State, under the provisions
of the Morrill Land-Grant Act of
1862, is required ‘. . . to promote
the liberal and practical educa-
ton of the industrial classes in
the several pursuits and profes-
sions of life’. :

“This new program follows the
intent of the Land-Grant Act in
that. it states emphatically that
technical assistance is available
to anyone, regardiess of where
he lives in the Commonwealth,
simply byasking -for it," Dr. Mar-
low: said.
