Making. Pennsylvania a better
place to live and work by apply-
ing existing technology to serve
the community, the Common-
wealth, and industry is the new
thrust of the Pennsylvania Tech-

‘nical Assistance Program.

PENNTAP, according to its. dl-
rector, Dr. H. LeRoy Marlow, was.
begun five years ago with service
to industry as its primary goal,
and with prospective “clients”
referred to various institutions: of
higher learning, libraries, and
other facilities, for the information
they sought.

“Now,” Dr. Marlow explained,
“PENNTAP. has established 2
statewide, non-overlapping tech-
nical Information. network to assist
In the transfer and application
of scientific technical information.
to municipalities, industries, health
agencies, governmental organiza-

fe
tions, and others.” PENNTAP# is’

sponsored by the Pennsylvania
Department of Commiéree and/ad=
ministered as.a continulng educa-
tion program of Pefifi*Stataxy >

Acquisition, interpretation, and:
transfer of problem-solving data
will be accomplished by several

members. of the Penn State fac-
ulty. Through this program, facts
gleaned. from literally billions of
pages of technical information.
and research data: will be placed,
free of charge, at the user's dis-
posal, providing. possible solu-
tions to existing problems, Dr.
Marlow said.

An example of the type of social
and economic benefit that could
be derived through the new’ sys-
tem would be to correct an in-
dustrial plant's discharge of pol-
lutants. PENNTAP, through exist-
ing. knowledge, could provide in-
formation to ‘correct the situation,
thus solving the industry's prob-
lem and at the same time helping
to improve the community's en-
vironment.. -

“The philosophy behind this

organization or individual who Is
able to provide the neded help,

either from existing public
sourees or professional consul-
tants. Only rarely, and -very.re-
luctanily, will we be<forced™ to

you.”

To receive technical Informa
tion, a client requests PENNTAP-
services through any of the 23:
Penn. State Continuing Education
district offices throughout the
Commonwealth. Upon receiving
an inquiry. about PENNTAP serv-
ices, the district office will secure
the individual’s name, address,
and ielephone number, and as-
sure him that his inquiry will re-
celve: prompt attention.

The .office receiving the Inquiry
will immediately forward it to. the
PENNTAP office at University
Park Campus. where it will be
processed by the staff.

A member of the PENNTAP
organization will contact the In-
guirer, determine the nature of
the problem, and direct if to an
existing unit which- can most
readily handie the problem, The
response, for example, might con-
sist of printed technical informa-
flon in response to a specific
‘qHestion, it might bé @ referral
to a consultant, manufacturer, or
«tate agency, or it might require
a visit by one of the technical
‘feld specialists.

Penn State, under the provisions
of the Morrill Land-Grant Act of
1862, is.required ‘. . . to promote
the: liberal and practical educa-
Hon of the industrial classes in
the several pursuits and profes-
sions of life’. :

“This new program follows the
intent of the Land-Grant Act in
that. it states emphatically that
technical assistance is available
to. anyone, regardless of where
he lives. in. the Commonwealth,
simply by asking -for it," Dr. Mar-
low: said.
