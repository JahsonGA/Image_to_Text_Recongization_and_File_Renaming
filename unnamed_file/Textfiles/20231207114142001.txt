the community is a new thrust
. on the Pennsylvania State Uni-
_ versity York Campus. It is the

Pennsylvania Technical ‘Assis-

tance Program, sponsored by

the state Department of Com-

merce and administered’ as a
continuing education program
by Penn. State, with York

Campus as one of its locations.

PENNTAP, according to
John Marshall, assistant direc-
tor for continuing education on
the York Campus, ‘‘was begun
tive years ago with service to
industry as its primary: goal,
and with prospective ‘clients’
referred to various institutions
of higher learning, libraries
and other facilities for the in-
formation they sought. Now,
PENNTAP *has established a
statewide, non-overlapping
technical information network
to assist in the transfer and ap-
plication of scientific technical
information to municipalities,
industries,. health agencies,
governmental organizations
and others.”

Acquisition, interpretation,
and transfer of problem-sol-
ving data will be accomplished
by several full time, technical-
ly. qualified members of the
Penn State faculty from the
Colleges of Science, Engineer-
ing, and Earth and Minera! |

data will be placed, free of
charge, at, the user’s disposal,
providing possible solutions to
existing problems. An example
of the type of social and eco-
nomic benefit that could be de-
rived through the new systems
would be to correct an industri-
al plant’s discharge of pollu-
tants. PENNTAP could pro-
vide information to correct
situation, thus solvirig the in-
and at the
nefpitig -to improve
_sa community's datironment.”
