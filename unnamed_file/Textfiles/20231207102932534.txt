THE SMALLER MANUFACTURER - MARCH 1972, pp 2,3

PENNTAP OFFERS AID

TO SMALLER MANUFACTURERS

Not every question PENNTAP gets
asked is the $64,000 question, but
to a myriad of small manufacturing
firms in the greater
the answer to a E
small nagging
production or
operational prob-
fem can mean a
substantial total :
savings.

Unfortunately,
most firms don’t
know they can
ake their problems to PENNTAP
(the Pennsylvania Technical Assis-
ance Program), a vital part of the
Pennsylvania State University’s divi-
sion of Continuing Education.

Problems come in all forms
hrough PENNTAP’s statewide re-
ceiving stations, and for one West-
ern Pennsylvania concern they were
pigeons—or, in more explicit terms,
e elimination of pigeons from
heir plant. A manufacturer of out-
door plastic signs needed informa-
ion concerning wind pressures
against signs at various heights, so
he size of sign ‘posts could be de-
ermined. Another manager was in-
erested in how the use of a com-
puter could help his business be
more profitable. An individual entre-
preneur contemplating the opening
of a polyester repair business
wanted pertinent literature.

By providing firms with possible
solutions from existing data, PENN-
TAP hopes to assist the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania in eliminat-
ing waste and'in achieving greater
economic and social benefits. Even
those questions outside the scope
of PENNTAP will be referred to an
organization or individual that can
provide the help needed,

On the pollution side, for exam-
ple, information was requested on
the recycling of plastics, methods of
improving internal air pollution from
inplant welding, removing dust from
air in blacktop plants, pollution
problems with asbestos, air pollu-
tion in regards to gravure printing,

and methods to prevent bacteria for-
mation in water used in small hu-
midifiers.

Although geared to answering
questions which are scientific and
technical in nature such as provid-
ing information on the regeneration
of H.SO, and iron salts from pickle
liquor, and providing a steel firm
with a conversion table for the trans-
fer of information from the British
to the American language, PENN-
TAP through its four technical field
specialists has been’ posed with a
wide range of inquiries,

For instance, questions include:
“How does a firm train Vo-Tech stu-
dents in the needle trade? What is
a replacement for cedar in pencils?
What type of inventory control would
be effective for a furniture com-
pany? What is the source for health
laws in Pennsylvania? Where does
one obtain the names of indepen-
dent welding consultants who could
testify in court on faulty mold weld-
ments?”

Designed to assist small manu-
facturers, among others, in getting
a better return on their tax dollar,
PENNTAP's statewide program pro-
vides face-to-face information dis-
sémination through its technical
field specialists. They, however, do
not stand alone.

In other words, the total resources
of The Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity are available to the user through
the technical field specialists as
each is employed jointly by Contin-
uing Education and their academic
department of the University whi
provides almost unlimited sourc
of information. The deans of the <
propriate colleges of the Univers
are committed to the program a
are responsible for the acaderr
content being disseminated.

To insure that the technical fie
specialists function as effectively
possible with the other componen
of the statewide network, their acti
ities are coordinated through tl
officd to. the PENNTAP director, [
H. LeRoy Marlow, at the Universi

Park Campus, ~

Marlow noted that in addition to
the information supplied by the in-
dividual academic departments and
PENNTAP’s Library information Sys-
tem, “there are many institutions—
state and federal information depos-
itories, universities, library systems,
private laboratories, and governmen-
tal agencies—across the state that
can provide all the technical knowl-
edge that can be found.”

Here's the way PENNTAP works in
Western Pennsylvania. Any industry,
business, municipality, health. or-
ganization, government agency, civic
group, or individual entrepreneur
can request PENNTAP services
through the Continuing Education
Offices in Altoona, DuBois, Erie, Mc-
Keesport, Monaca, New Kensington,
Sharon, and Uniontown,

The office receiving the inquiry
will request the caller's name, ad-
dress, and telephone number, and
then immediately forward it to the
PENNTAP office at the University
Park Campus. (There is no need for
nonscientific personnel to struggle
with technical terms.)

A technical field specialist will
contact the inquirer, determine the
nature of the problem, and direct it
to an existing unit which can most
readily handle the problem. The re-
sponse, for example; might consist
of printed information in response
to a specific question, it might be a
referral to a consultant, manufac-
turer, or state agency, or it might
require a visit by one of the techni-
cal field specialists.

The program's favorable reception
by its user can be attributed to three
factors intrinsic in PENNTAP’s or-
ganization and nlanning
