‘Making Pennsylvania a better
place to live and work, by ap-
lying technology to serve
business. industry and the
community is a new thrust on
the Pennsylvania State

University Mont Alto Campus.

It is the Pennsylvania Technical
Assistance Program, sponsored
by the state Department of
Commerce and administered as
a continuing education program

‘Biyde

by Penn State, with the Mont
Alto Campus as one of its
locations.

PENNTAP, according to
Johnson, assistant
jrector . for continuing
education on the Penn State
Mont Alto Campus, ‘‘was begun
five years ago with service to
industry as its primary goal,
and with prospective ‘clients’

-referred to various institutions

>=

of higher learning, libraries and
other facilities for the in-
formation they sought. Now,
PENNTAP has established a
statewide, nonoverlapping
technical information network
to assist in the transfer and
application of scientific
technical information to
municipalities, industries,
health agencies, governmental
organizations and others.”

Acquisition, _ interpretation,
and transfer of problem-solving
data will be accomplished by
several full time, technically
qualified members of the Penn
State faculty from the colleges
of Science, Engineering, and
Earth and Mineral Science.

Through this program,
technical information and
research data will be placed,
free of charge, at the user’s

“disposal, providing possible

solutions to existing problems.

: An example of the type of social

and economic benefits that
could be derive through the
new systems would be to
correct an industrial plant's
discharge of pollutants.
PENNTAP could provide in-
formation to correct the
situation, thus solving the in-
dustry’s problem and at the
same time helping to improve a
community's environment.

Anyone can request Penntap
services by contacting the
continuing education office on
the Mont Alto Campus. The
Campus will immediately

! forward the request to the

PENNTAP office at University
Park. A member of the PENN-
TAP organization wili contact
the inquirer, determine the
nature of the problem and
determine what unit can most
readily handle the problem. it
may be through printed
technical information, a con-
sultant or state agency, or it

may mcvisit by one of
PENNE. Sq--fechnical field
specialists. * ”
