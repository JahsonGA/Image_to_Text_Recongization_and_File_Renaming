that there was a better way to

» In past years, PENNTAP’s
‘emphasis has’ been. on. industry,
and Marlow estimates. that 7.8
per cent of the state’s 17,000
companies have benefited:  ~
But the project has been ex-

Marlow declared,
“whether it be snow removal,
black-topping, pollution control
or whatever.” ~

Here’s the way PENNTAP
works:

—Ttiose seeking help cat call
any’of Penn State’s 23. Continu-
ing Education offices across the
state.

~The office. takes the name
of the caller, who is later con-
tacted by one of PENNTAP’s
four fulltime field. specialists.

~The field man analyzes the
probiems atid determines where
to: go for the answers.

—We figure there are about
146 institutions across the state
that. can provide all the techni-
eal knowledge that can be
found,” said Marlow.

“We're tied to tniversities, li-
brariés, private laboratories,
companies — ali the federal
and: state, private and public
sources,” he added. “There may

——

be: a font. of knowledge that we
don't kno: about, but I'd defi-
-nitély say We're close to 100 per
‘eent.””

There Have beén instances
when certain technology was
not available, Marlow admit-
ted, in which case PENNTAP.
suggested the client -pay for
new Tesearth.

“But at least they knew they
were not: using their money to
duplicate research that had al-
ready been done,” Marlow
noted.

“That's been the problem in
the past. This nation spent §27
billion in research and develop-
ment last year and it’s esti-
mated half of if: may have been
wasted in duplication; ‘

PENNTAP. gets money from
the state Department of Com-
merce and the National Science
Foundation.

A: Wemember advisory ¢oun-
cil evaluates the program éach
year, “as. does the Governor’s
Scierice Advisory Council and
the state Engineering Founda-
tion.

“As far as. | know we are the
only state in the nation with a

- technology delivery system like

this,” Marlow said. “President
Nixon is proposing the same
thing nationwide, but we've
been doing it for years,

“The expertise of the nation
is at our fingertips, but people
can’t use it unless they ‘know
about it.” Pa
