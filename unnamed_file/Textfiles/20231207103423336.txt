Find Obscure Information

to build a better mousetrap, but
to find out if somebody else al-
ready has.

That’s the aim of the Penn-
sylvania Technical = TAssistance
Program (PENNTAP), a State
venture to uncover obscure re-
ports and translate | scientific
‘lingo so even the smailest busi-
ness or municipality can find
its needle in. the haystack of
technology.

Nonetheless, Marlow, a ma-

TAP success stories. Among
them:

—A Connellsville foundry
learned through PENNTAP
that there was a better way to
sand cast metal. The A&B
Foundry now estimates it is
saving $44,000 per year.

about to pay $1,000 for a study

the same study had already
been done.

Here's the way PENNTAP
works:

—Those seeking help can calt

ing Education offices across the
state.

~—The office takes the name
of the caller, who is later con-
tacted by one of PENNTAP’s
four fulltime field specialists.

—The field man analyzes the
problems and determines where
to go for the answers.

—"'We figure there are about
146 institutions across the state
that can provide all the techni-
cal knowledge that can be
found,” said Marlow.

“We're tied to universities, li-
braries, private laboratories,
companies ~— all the federal

sources,” he added. *‘There may

when certain technology was
not available, Marlow admit-
ted, in which case PENNTAP
suggested the client pay for
new researth.

“But at least they knew they
were not using their money to
duplicate research that had al-
ready been done,” Marlow
noted,

“That's been the problem in
the past. This nation spent §27
billion in research and develop-
ment last year and it's esti-
mated half of it may have been
wasted in duplication. "'”

PENNTAP gets money from
the state Department of Com-
merce and the National Science
Foundation.

A lS-member advisory coun-
cil evaluates the program each
year, as does the Governor's
Science Advisory Council and
the state Engineering Founda-
tion.

“As far as I know we are the
only state in the nation with a

.technology delivery system like

this,"’ Marlow said. “President
Nixon is proposing the same
thing nationwide, but we've
been doing it for years.

“The expertise of the nation
is at our fingertips, but people
can’t use it unless they know
about it.” “a
