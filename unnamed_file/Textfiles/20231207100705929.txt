Ray Cromley was a bit be
hind in his reading when, in
his column of Sept. 24, ha
called for joint acien -
neer-industrialist cross-fertfli-
zation teams.

‘There is considerable bis-
tory of programs past aod
present that strive to metch
societal problems of i try,
medicine, ete., with snlttions
“generated through the efforts
of ecientists and technologists.

The National Aeronautics
and Space Administration by
an, act..of Congress estab
ii the Office of Technology

183.

“This “Office initiated two

industrial sector.

Medical researctiers and
“Practitioners were encour-
aged to use relevant space
and other technologies through
Biomedical Application Teams.

Both techniques, although
extremely limited in funding,
ave been very syccessiul in
bringing new technologies to

The U.S. Department of Com-

at the same time established
a national network for the

government supported this
Program for several years.

Furthermore, it just isn't as

Therefore, we are far tess
aware of the constant, persis-
