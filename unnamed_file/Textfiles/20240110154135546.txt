UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa.--Making Pennsylvania a better place to live and work by applying existing technology to

serve the community, the Commonwealth, and industry is the new thrust of the Pennsylvania Technical Assistance Program.

PENNTAP, according to its director, Dr. H. LeRoy Marlow, was begun five years ago with service to industry as its primary

goal, and with prospective "clients" referred to various institutions of higher learning, libraries, and other facilities for the

information they sought.

"Now, " Dr. Marlow explained, "PENNTAP has established a statewide, non-overlapping technical information network to |

assist in the transfer and application of scientific technical information to municipalities, industries, health agencies, govern-

mental organizations, and others. '' PENNTAP is sponsored by the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce and administered.as a
beer ge

continuing education program of The Pennsylvania State University.

Acquisition, interpretation, and transfer of problem-solving data will be accomplished by several full-time, technically

qualified members of the Penn State faculty. Through this program, facts gleaned from literally billions of pages of technical

information and' research data will be placed, free of charge, at the user's disposal, providing possible solutions to existing

problems, Dr. Marlow said.

An example of the type of social and economic benefit that could be derived through the new systems would be to correct

an industrial plant's discharge of pollutants. PENNTAP, through existing knowledge, could provide information to correct the

situation, thus solving the industry's problem and at the same time helpi.ag to improve the community's environment.
