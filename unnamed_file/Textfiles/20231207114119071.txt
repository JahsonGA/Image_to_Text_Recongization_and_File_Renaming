goes awry as far as a Con-
nellsville foundryman is con-
cerned.

As a newly promoted general
manager of the New A & B
Foundry, Inc., Charles M. Davis
knew he didn’t have all the an-
swers and decided to attend a
Pennsylvania Technical As-
sistance Program (PENNTAP)
workshop on sand casting.

As a result, his foundry is
realizing an estimated yearly
savings of $44,000.

Changes instituted by the
foundry in sand control, gleaned
from the workshop, effected a
300 per cent improvement on
casting surface finishes.
virtually eliminating scrap due
to sand related causes.

In addition to the direct labor
costs, Davis feels that the foun-
dry, which has gross shipments
of between $300,000 and $400,000,
can also tlaim-a real savings of
approximately $23,000 due to
reduced gverhead.

A producer of high quality
non-ferrous sand castings for
various types of industry, the
foundry produces castings which
vary in weight from a few
ounces to 200 pounds.

Because considerable skill is
required in gating and feeding
the castings, as well as in con-
stant checks on sand conditions
and metal controls, Davis and
his sand technician (now plant
foreman), George E. Timko Sr.,
went to the Workshop Seminars
on Sand Testing Techniques for
Pennsylvania Foundrymen in
Pittsburgh simply because they
needed expanded knowledge.
They wanted to know how to use
data they had obtained from in-
plant testing, and what effects
additives had on sand.

Under the direction of Wesley
Winter, associate professor of
industrial engineering, The
Pennsylvania State University,
the two men learned how to
properly conduct sand testing.

well recognized individuals in
their fields filled in the gaps that
existed in our minds allowing us
to come up with answers on
what ta do. We came away from
the workshop with a new com-
pactibility test and a thorough
knowledge for interpreting test
results with corrective action.”
Prior to the workshop, the
foundry was running between 10
and 13 per cent scrap due to all
conditions, but since the
changeover, this figure dropped
to between 3 and 5 per cent. Of

for his pattern shop, the New A
& B Foundry became a full-time
bperation in the early 60s and
was incorporated in 1965. In
January 1971, the foundry be-
came a subsidiary of The Dura-
loy Co., Scottdale, an alloy -
steel producer.

Davis, an industrial engineer,
joined the foundry following his
graduation from The Penn-
sylvania State University in
June 1969. Assisted by his bro-
ther, George C., plant manager,
Davis oversees the operation

20 people and has a physical
plant of 7,600 square feet.
Approximately. 30 per cent o!
the foundry’s products are
aluminum castings sold com-
mercially, while 65 per cent are
brass and bronze castings
manufactured for commercial
and nuclear applications. The
remaining 5 per cent are sold as
dies, molds, and specialty items.
Some of the foundry’s customers
are manufacturers of new and
replacement parts for the coal
mining industry, original equip-
castings for manu-
facturers of pumps, valves,
cleaning, and marking equip- :
ment. Die work is also done for
