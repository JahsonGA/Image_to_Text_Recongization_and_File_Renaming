Penn State Program Helps Crille

The theory that a” little
knowledge is. a dangerous: thing |
goes awry as far as a Con-

nelisville foundryman is con-|
existed in: our minds allowing us

cerned.

As a newly promoted general
manager of the New A & B
Foundry, Inc., Charles M. Davis
knew he didn’t have all the an-
swers and decided to attend a
Pennsylvania ‘Technical As-
sistance Program’ (PENNTAP)
workshop on sand castitig.

As ‘a result, his foundry is
realizing an estimated yearly
savitigs of $44,000. i

Changes. instituted by the
foundry in sand:control, gleatied
from the workshop, effected a
300 per cent improvement on
casting surface finishes —
virtually eliminating scrap due
to sand related causes.

In addition to the direct labor

dry, which lias gross shipments
of between $300,000 atid: $400,000,
can also ¢laim’a real savings of
approximately $23,000: due to
reduced overhead.

A producer of high quality
non-ferrous sand castings for
various types of industry, the
foundry producés castitigs which
vary in weight from a few
ounces to 200. pourids.

Because coisiderable skill is
required in gating and feeding
the castings, as well as in con-
stant checks off sand conditions
and metal controls, Davis and
his sand technician (now plant
foreman), Géorge E. Timko Sr.,
went. to the Workshop Seminars
on Sand Testing Techtiiques for
Pennsylvania. Foundtymen in
Pittsburgh simply because they
needed expanded kriowledge.
They wanted to know how to use
data they had: obtaitied from in-
plant: testing, and what effects
additives had-on sand.

Under the direction of Wesley
Winter, associate professor of
industrial ‘engineering, The
Pennsylvania Staté University,
the two men learned how to

properly conduct sand testing.

operation in the early 60s and
was incorporated in 1965. In
January 1971, the foundry be-
came a subsidiary of The. Dura-
loy Co., Seottdale, an alloy -
steel producer.

Davis, att industrial engineer,
joined the foundry following his
graduation from The Penn-
sylvania State University in
June 1969. Assisted by his. bro-
ther, George €., plant manager,
Davis oversees. the operation
which: employés approximately |
20 people and has a physical
