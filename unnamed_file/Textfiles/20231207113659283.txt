UNIVERSITY PARK; Pa.
(AP) ~ The trick today is not
to build a better mousetrap, but!
to find out if somebody else al-
ready has.

That's the aim of the Penn-
sylvania Technical Assistance!
Program (PENNTAP), a state
venture to uncover obscure re-
ports and translate scientific
lingo so even the smallest busi-
ness or municipality can find
its needle in the haystack of
technology.

the state.

of the caller, who is later con-
tacted by one of PENNTAP’s
Your fulltime field specialists. |

problems and determine where
to go for the answers. j

—“‘We figure there are about|
146 institutions across the state
that can provide all the techni-
cal knowledge that can be
found,” said Marlow.

“We're tied to universities, 1i-
fbraries, private laboratories

‘be a font of knowledge that we
don't know about, but I'd defi

There have been instances’
fwhen certain technology was
not available, Marlow admit-'

jSuggested the client pay for
new research.

“But at least they knew they
were not using their money to
‘duplicate research that had al-
ready been done,” Marlow:
noted. :
“That's been the problem in
‘the past. This nation spent $27
billion in research and develop-|
ment last year and it's esti

wasted in duplication.” —_

“As far as I know we are the

technology delivery system like
this,’ Marlow said. ‘President
