If research will put your company ahead of the
competition, our Office of Science and Technology (OST}
may be able to provide you with just the information you
need. Let's discuss two OST programs and how they can
help you.

The Pennsylvania Science and Engineering
Foundation (PSEF) and the Pennsylvania Technical
Assistance Program (PENNTAP). PSEF can help initiate
original research in the knowledge areas that are
important to your company’s future. PENNTAP can help
insure your company's future by locating and giving you
technical information that already exists.

Here's how they work: PSEF is a funding agency. it
grants ‘‘start up" funds for technical projects. in
Pennsylvania which can:

1. Benefit the economy of the State;

2. Help solve urban and environmental problems

and;

3. Attract on-going funding from federal or private

sources.

For example, among 127 recent scientific projects
PSEF has directly funded are: Synthesis of the cancer
treatment drug ‘‘Camptothecin,’’ development of a new
capacitor material for a Pennsylvania company which

was hard pushed by foreign competition, thereby
generating sales of $500,000 and maintaining 35 jobs,
and The National Transportation Center, which
coordinates transportation contracts and research
throughout the country. It can even award sub-contracts
within the state. So, eventually your company may
directly benefit from a PSEF grant.

Now, let’s talk about PENNTAP which provides
technological and scientific information to business: and
to the community. If the information you need exists,
PENNTAP will help you find it. If it doesn’t exist,
PENNTAP will tell you.

Examples of PENNTAP’s help? We've saved one
company $100,000, and another over 300 man-hours
of research. ;

lurge you to use PENNTAP and to take advantage
of the research funded by PSEF. Both are part of our
Office of Science and Technology—helping
Pennsylvania's businesses stay out front.
