PENNTAP Workshop Aids=

The theory that a Httie knowl-
edge is a dangerous thing goes
awry as far as a Connelisville
foundryman is concerned. As
a newly promoted general mat-
ager of the New A & B Foundry, |
Inc., Charles M. Davis knew)

‘he didn't bave ali the answeres .

and cecided to attend a
Pennsylvania Technical Assist-
mace Program (PONNTAP)
workshop on sand casting. As
a tesult. his fou is realizi
an estimated yearly savings
$44,000.

_ The reason. Changes institut-
ed by the foundry in sand
contrel, gleaned from the work-
shop, effected a 300 per cent
improvement on casting surface
fini she s—virlwally eliminat-
ing scrap due to sand related

causes. .
In addition to the direct labor

costs, Davis feels that the-

foundry, wiich has gross ship-
ments of between 000 and
$400,000, can siso claim a real
saviogs of ‘oxianately $23,000
due to reduned overhead.

allowing us to come up with
‘answers on what to do. We
came away from the workshop
with a new compatibitey itty test
aod a thorough knowledge for
interpreting test results with
corrective action.”

Prior to the workshop, the
foundry was running between
ten and thirteen per cent scrap
due ta all conditions, but since
the change over, this figure
dropped: to between three and
five per cent. Of this lower
percentage, five per cent repre-
cants sand casting defects—sur-
face defects, scabs, buckles, rat
tails, surface roughness,
veining, and blow holes.

Started in 1958 as a part

time experimental foundry by; .

Davis's father, I. Clifford, to
provide commercialy  un-
available dies for his pattern
shop, the New A & B Foundry
became a full time operation
in the early sixties and was
incorporated in 1965. In January
Jozi, the foundry became a sub-
sidiary of The Duraloy
