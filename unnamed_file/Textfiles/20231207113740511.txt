This problem was turned over
to Robert McCormick, a PENN-

bituminous concrete paving.

HE LOCATED A publication
in which several of Andrews’
jqQuestions ‘were answered, In ad-
dition, he discovered severali
citles with a temperature and
precipitation range, comparable
to that of Beaver Falls, where
these methods were being used.

With this information, and
after talks with engineers from|®&
other, cities, Andrews could de-|
termine whether to adopt the
methods in: Beaver Falis.
