oracking of asphalt paving ‘under pany that TAPS

moisture, bing. process,

This problem was turned over
to Robert McCormick, a PENN-
TAP technical specialist in the
College of Engineering at Penn
State. After talking with An-
drews, Prof. McCormick, with
the assistance of Anthony Ven-

search of literature related to!
bituminous concrete paving.

HE LOCATED A publication
in which several of Andrews’
questions were answered, In ad-
dition, he discovered severali
citles with a temperature and
precipitation range, comparable
to that of Beaver Falls, where
these methods were being used.

With this information, and
after talks with engineers from|®&
other, cities, Andrews could de-|
termine whether to adopt the
methods in Beaver Falls.

PENNTAP has assisted organi-

—A plastic mold manufactur-!
ing process, which formerly re-j
quired 40 to 60 hours of hand

—One manulacturing concern

basis of specifications supplied
by PENNTAP. A commercially-
produced furnace was estimated
at $150,000 and actual cost was
$50,000.
