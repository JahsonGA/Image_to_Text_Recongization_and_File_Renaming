Services to Local Governments

(Editor’s note-—from time to
time we have printed “lists of
services” available to local gov-

ernmental secretaries. Most re- —

cent of these was the services
of the Penna. Department of
Community Affairs. This ar-
ticle on PENNTAP is reprinted
with permission from the Key-
notes Newsletter of the Penn-
sylvania Local Government
Foundation.)

An unfortunate fact about
government is that all ton fre-
quently valuable services are
available which go unused be-
cause nobody Knows about them.

Such a service was brought to
the attention of some local of-
ficials who attended a_ recent
workshop on the applications of
technology to local governments
which was held at the Pennsyl-
vania State University.

The Pennsylvania Technical
Assistance Program, PENN-
TAP, according to its director
Dr. Leroy Marlow, has estab-
lished a statewide, non-over-
lapping technical information
network to assist in the transfer
and application of scientific and
technical information to munici-
palities, industries, health
agencies, governmental organi-
zations and others. The_pro-
gram is sponsored by the Penn-
sylvania Department of Com-
merce and administered as a
continuing education program of
the Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity.

Acquisition, intepretation, and
transfer of problem-solving data
will be accomplished by several
full-time, technically qualified
members of the Penn State fac-
ulty. Through this program,
facts gleaned from literally bil-
lions of pages of technical in-
formation and research data
will be placed, free of charge,
at the user’s disposal, providing’
possible solutions to existing
problems, Dr. Marlow said.

“The philosophy behind this
network is that no person will
be stuck on dead center,” Dr.
Marlow said. “Even those ques-
tions which are outside the scope
of PENNTAP will be referred to
an organization or individual
who is able to provide the need-
ed help, either from existing
public sources or professional
consultants. Only rarely, and
very ruluctantly, will we
forced to reply to anyone, ‘we
can’t help you.’”

To receive technical informa-
tion, a client requests PENN-
TAP services thrauch any cf the
23 Penn State Continuing Edu-
cation district offices through-
out the Commonwealth. Upon
receiving an inquiry about
PENNTAP services, the district
office will secure the individual’s
name, address, and telephone
number, and assure him that’
his inquiry will receive prompt
attention.

The office receiving the in-
quiry will immediately forward
it to the PENNTAP office at
University Park Campus where
it will be processed by the staff.
A-member of the PENNTAP

‘organization will contact the in-

quirer, determine the nature of

‘the problem_and direct it to an

existing” ufif which can most
readily handle the problem.
The response, for example,
might consist of printed tech-
nical information in response to
a specific question, it might be
a referral to a consultant, manu-
facturer, or state agency, or it
might require a visit by one of
the technical field specialists.
