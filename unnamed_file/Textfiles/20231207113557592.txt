_ The trick today is nor to build a
better mousetrap, but to. find
jout if somebody else already
has. .

That’s the aim of the Pen-
sylvania Technical Assistance
|{Program (PENNTAP), a state

venture to uncover’ obscure
i|reports and translate scientific
illingo so even the smallest
business or municipality can
find its needle in the haystack
of technology.

Yet while PENNTAP’s free
service has been available more
_|than five years, the program
has suffered from the malady
its treats — unawareness.

publicity,” said Dr. Roy Mar-
low, the 47-year-old perpe-
tual motion: machine who runs
PENNTAP from a single,
unimposing office at Penn
State.

Most small businessmen and
borough ‘managers are too busy
on the firing line to know what
is available,” added the boyish
faced Marlow, who also heads
Management Services at Penn
State and puts in an 80-hour
work week,

Nonetheless, Marlow, a
machine gun talker, is quick to
cut loose with a volley of PENN-
TAP success stories. Among
them:

Textile Machine Co. of
Reading had a $30 part on a
knitting machine which failed
frequently and caused ex-

pensive shutdowns. PENNTAP!

supplied a 2%4-page article
showing a better way to harden
the metal part. None has failed
in two years since.

_mA Connelsvile foundry
learned,through PENNTAP that
there was a better way to sand
east metal. The A&B Foundry
now estimates it is saving
$44,000 per year.

—A ‘plastics manufacturer
about to pay $1,000 for a study
was advised by PENNTAP that
the’ same study had already
been done. 2

“This year the total cost of|
our program will be $247,000.
We ought to generate two to
three times that budget in sav-
ings,” stated Marlow, who
associates say spends fax pen-
nies as if they were dollars of
his own.

In past year, PENNTAP’s

™remphasis has been on industry,

and. Marlow estimates that 7.8
per cent of the state’s 17,000;

4| companies have benefited.

But the project has been ex-

‘ panded and targets now include

Pennsylvania’s 12,000
municipalities. .

“1 would say that over a
period of time there would not
be a municipality in-the state
that we could not chelp in.some
way,” Marlow declared,
whether it be snow removal,
black-topping, pollution Control
or whatever.”

Here’s the way PENNTAP
works:

—Those seeking help can call

‘li any of Penn State’s 23 Continu-
ling Education offices across the
:1| state.

| The office takes the name
of aller, who is later con-
—

tacted by one of PENNTAP’s
four fulltime field specialists. |

~The field man analyze the
problems and determine where
to go for the answers.

“We figure there are about!
146 institutions across the state}
that can provide all the}
technical knowledge that can be
found,”’ said Marlow.

“We're tied to universities,
libraries, private laboratories
companies — all the federal and
state, private and public
sources,” he added. ‘There
may be a fent of knowledge that
we don’t know about, but I’d
definitely say we’re close to 100
per cent.”

There have been instances
when certain technology was
not available, Marlow admitted,
in which case PENNTAP sug-
gested the client pay for new
research.

“But at leat they knew they
were not using their money to
duplicate research that had:
already been done,” Marlow!
noted. !

“That's been the problem in
the past. This nation spent $27
billion in research and
development last year and it’s
estimated half of it may have
been wasted in duplication.”

PENNTAP gets moeny from
the state Department of Com-
merce and the National Science
Foundation.
