Fires program.

Students Against Fires, the theme of this
year’s Student Competition On Relevant
Engineering, is a project which includes
students from:colleges and universities iti the

the state of the art of fighting fires.” The

fires and: on improved means of prevention.

Bill Sickles (Sth-mechanical engineering)’
