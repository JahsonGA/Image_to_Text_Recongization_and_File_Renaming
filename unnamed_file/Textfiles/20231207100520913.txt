CENTER FOR FLOOD AID

PENNTAP (Pennsylvania Technical As-
sistance Program) has organized a techni-
cal assistance center at the Wilkes-Barre
Campus to aid flood victims.

George W. Bierly, Campus director, has
urged Wyoming Valley residents to take
advantage of the services of the assistance
center in the restoration of homes, busi-
nesses and industries, and communities.

Technical information, avallable free of
charge, will be provided to those seeking
it or advice providing possible solutions
to problems created by the floods. Rep-
resentatives from University Park, the
Wilkes-Barre Campus, and the Wilkes-

_ Barre area building trades will be avail-
to answer inquiries and, if needed, make
visits to aid those wishing information.
