In area of communications Penn Tap hopes

to cooperate with the PENNA, FIREMAM in gett
ing out the word te the fi refignters of the
State, With Dick Bland in a near-by office
we should have coverage on a national basis
also. Penna, is ona of the few States that
is not organized enough to even be able to
record its fire loss in life and progerty.
there is no official tabulation in Pa. Ti
State Police is the closest in records with
lives, There is no complete list of Pa.
Fire Companies available, soma good ones,
but absolutely no complete ones, let alone
list of fire chiefs. G4111 is compiling a
list of Pa, Fire Companies and is at 2890
plus and counting,

Penn Tep is at your service, cali if we
can help you. Penn Tan, c/o dilliam C.
