The trick today is not to build
a better mousetrap, but to find

That's the aim of the Penn-

Program (PENNTAP), a state
venture to uncover obscure re-

Yet while PENNTAP’s free
service has. been available
more than five years, the pro-
gram has suffered from the
malady it treats — unaware-
ness.

“T'd like to say we're a.
houschold word but we're fot.
Our No. 1 problem is lack ‘of

ublicity,"’ ‘said Dr. Roy Mar-
tow. the 47-year-old perpetual |

PENNTAP from a single, unim-
posing office at Penn State.

“Most smaij businessmen and
borough managers are tco busy
on the firing line to know what

Here's the way PENNTAP
works:

-The office takes the name
of the caller, who is later con-
tacted by one of PENNTAP's
four fulltime field specialists.

—The field men analyze the
preblems and: determine where
to go for the answers.

“We figure there are about
146 institutions across the state
that can provide all the techni-
eal nowledge that can be
found.” said Marlow.

“We're tied to universities, li-
braries, private laboratories,
companies — all the federal
and state, private and public
sources,”’ he added. ‘‘There may
be a font of knowledge that we
don’t know about. but I'd defi-
nitely say we're close to 100 per
