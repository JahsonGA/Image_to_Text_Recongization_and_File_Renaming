Having previously quizzed
PENNTAP on several informa-
tion needs, Torrey talked
directly to Anthony J. Venett,
technica! librarian and director
of the Library Information

PENNTAP's role as a
transfer agent was to provide

Venett supplied Torrey with
such literature — information
on test and -performance of
fasteners accrued by the Na-

Administration.

This information helped solve
Eriez’s problem and reduced
their costs and, more impor-
tantly, ‘it allowed them to
release their orders for
manufacturing.
