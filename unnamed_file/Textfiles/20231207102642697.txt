MORE DOERS NEEDED IN TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Technology transfer is essentially a | success that Dr. David believes

matter of communication and the
principal elements in the process
are the communicators. There
must be something to communicate
but at present there seems to be a
shortage of receivers. This is the
way that Dr. E. E. Hardy, director of
Monsanto’s Dayton Laboratory,
views the matter.

At a National Symposium on
Technology Transfer in Washington,
D.C., last week, Dr. Hardy noted
that technology transfer has always
had a surplus of advocates but a
shortage of doers. He believes that
it is time for the doers to emerge so
that return from the investment in
technology, research, and develop-
ment may be increased.

The symposium was sponsored
jointly by seven organizations: the
American Chemical Society's Divi-
sion of Industrial and Engineering
Chemistry, along with the American
Institute of Chemical Engineers,
American Society for Metals, Ameri-
can Society for Nondestructive Test-
ing, American Society for Quality
Control, American Society for Test-
ing and Materials, and the Chemical
Society of Washington.

The Federal Government agrees
with Dr. Hardy, and presidential sci-
ence adviser Edward E. David
thinks that the renewed assault on
generating greater returns from
technology transfer may succeed.
In reviewing the current status of
technology transfer, Dr. David cites
Japanese success as something of a
model.
rent technology has been imported
from abroad, mostly through licens-
ing agreements.

Japan sends her best technolo
gists throughout the world to see
what is going on. They “experi-
ence” technology and bring home
what is needed to further Japan's
interests. Having a well-developed
idea of what is needed at home, the
Japanese representatives can be
selective. The Japanese are also
quite willing to duplicate state-of-
the-art technology for immediate
benefits. Unlike the U.S., where
there is a built-in mental block
against using the other man’s ex-
perience, the Japanese are very
adept at capitalizing on the experi-
ence of others.

Another reason for the Japanese

Nearly all of Japan's cur- |’

might be used in the U.S. is a con-
certed government-industry policy
for easier assimilation of new tech-
nology. The Japanese regulate their
markets simultaneously for maxi-
mum benefit. But above all, the
Japanese have a clear goal in mind
when they augment their industries
with science and technology from
any source.

Dr. David believes that, although
the Japanese experience is not
totally adaptable to the U.S. situa-
tion, the general rules for successful
technology transfer have been iden-
tified. But the seductive idea that
the $150 billion spent by the Govern-
ment on R&D since 1955 should
yield more than it has often masks
users’ problems. Dr. David beiieves
that most people view the well of
technology available from the Gov-
ernment as a storehouse of goodies
just waiting to be used directly. In
fact this isn’t true. The technology
available from the Government was
done originally with a specific pur-
pose in mind and no provision has
been made for its use beyond the
immediate objectives of the work.
In fact the available technology is in
the form of bits and pieces that the
user must restructure for his own
use, and this costs money. Dr.
David's implication is that the user
will have to provide utilization
funds and improve his own techni-
cal prowess before he can reap the
benefits of the Government's tech-
nology well.

Recently, however, the Federal
Government has helped the process
of technology transfer through such
activities as a more beneficial patent
policy and a National Aeronautics
and Space Administration-Defense
Department-Atomic Energy Com-
mission effort to package available ,
technology in more usable form,
particularly for other civilian agen-
cies of the Government.

Congress is also concerned with
technology transfer. In his tunch-
eon address to the symposium, Rep.
James W. Symington (D.-Mo.) cited
intragovernmental efforts at tech-
nology transfer as manifestations of «
the new efforts to gain more returns
from technology.

One of the aspects of technology
transfer that Mr. Symington regards
as crucial is getting technology |

Symington: entitechnology sentiment

transferred to local governmental
bodies. Local governments seldom
have competent advice on how to
use technology of any kind. To im-
prove this picture, Mr. Symington
recommends that scientists and
technologists make more of an
effort to provide this advice to local
administrators. Individually and
through professional organizations,
the scientific and technological com-
munities could do much more in an
advisory and in an entrepreneurial
way than they have done in the past,
he says.

Mr. Symington is also concerned
about the “antitechnology senti-
ment” that seems to be abroad in
many quarters. The fact is that
technology has provided much of
the present high standard of living
and will have a greater stake in
maintaining it. Ina real sense tech-
nology provides data and know-how,
but not the impersonal decision
often attributed to it by those who
may be technologically ignorant.
The decision to use technology is a
total community decision and not
one from the technical people alone.
Part of the confusion about tech-
nology, in Mr. Symington’s view, is
the lack of success in using high
technology for ordinary purposes.
This is really due to a lack of the
proper receptivity at the local level.
The situation requires a greater
technical awareness in all levels of
society.
