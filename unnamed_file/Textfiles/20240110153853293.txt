UNIVERSITY PARK —
Making Pennsylvania a better
place to live and work by
applying existing technology to
eserve the community, the
Commonwealth ani indusiry is
the new thrust of the
Pennsylvania Technical
Assistance Program.

PENNTAP, according to its
director, Dr. H. LeRoy Marlow,
was begun five years ago with
service to industry as ifs primary
goal, and with prospective
“clients” reletred to various
institutions of higher learning,
libraries, and other facilities for
the information they sought.

“Now,"' Dr, Marlow explains,
“PENNTAP has established a
Statewide, non-overlapping
technical information network to
assist in the transfer and
application of scientific technical

. information to municipalities,
“industries, health agencies,
governmental organizations, and
others.” PENNTAP is sponsored
by the Penasylvaaia Department
of Commerce and administered
as a continuing education
program of The Pennsylvania
State University.

Acquisition, interpretation,

and transfer of problem-solving .

data will be accomplished by
several full-time, technically
qualified members of the Penn
State faculty. Through this
program, facts gleaned from
literally billions of pages of
technical information and
research data will be placed. free
of charge, at the user's disposal,
providing possible solutions to
existing problems. Dr. Marlow
said.

An example of the type of
social and economic berefit that
could be derived through the
new system would be to correct
an industrial plant's discharge of
pollutants. PENNTAP, through
existing knowledge, could
provide information to correct
the situation, thus solving the
industry's problem and at the
same time helping to improve
the community's environment.

“The philosophy behind this

network is that no person will be

stuck on dead center,” Dr.

Martow said. “Even those’

questions which are outside the
scope of PENNTAP wilt be

referred to an organization or
individual who is able to provide
the necded help, either from
existing public sources or
professional consultants. Only
rarely, and very reluctantly, will
we be forced to reply to anyone,
‘we can't help you.’ ”

To receive technical
information. a client requests
PENNTAP services through any
of the 23 Penn State
continuing Education district
offices throughout the
Commonwealth. Upon receiving
an inquiry about PENNTAP
services. the district office will
secure the individual's name.
address, and telephone number,
and assure him that his iaquiry
will receive prompt attention.

The office receiving the
inquiry will immediately forward
it to the PENNTAP office at
University Park Campus where it
will be processed by the staff.

A member of the PENNTAP
organization will contact the
inquirer, determine the nature of
the problem, and direct it to an
existing unit which can most
readily handle the problem. The
response. for example, might
consist of printed technical
information in response to a
specific question. it might be a
referral to a consultant,
manufacturer, ot state agency, or
it might require a visit by one of
the technical field specialists.

Penn State. under the
provisions of the Morrill Land-
Grant Act of 1862, is required
*.,.to promote the liberal and
practical education of the
industrial classes in the several
pursuits and professions of life."

“This new program follows the
intent of the Land-Grant Act in
that it states emphatically that
technical assistance is available
to anyone, regardless of where
he lives in the Commonwealth,

simply by asking for it,” Dr.
Marlow said. WA
