Not Exactly a Household Word:

PENNTAP Offers Services

By GARY MICHOCES

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa.
(AP) — The trick today is not
to build a better mousetrap, but
to find out if somebody else al-
ready has.

That’s the aim of the Penn-
sylvania Technical Assistance
Program (PENNTAP), a state
venture to uncover obscure re-
ports and translate scientific
lingo so even the smallest busi-
hess or municipality can find
its needle in the haystack of
technology.

Yet while PENNTAP’s free
service has been available
more than five years, the pro-
gram has suffered from the
malady it treats — unaware-
Ness,

‘Td like to say we're a
household word but we’re not.
Our No. 1 problem is lack of
publicity,” said Dr. Roy Mar-
low, the 47-year-old perpetual
motion machine who runs
PENNTAP from a single, unim-
posing office at Penn State.

Most small businessmen and
borough managers are too busy
on the firing line to know what
is available,” added the boyish
faced Marlow, who also heads
Management Services at Penn
State and puts in an 80-hour
work week.

Nonetheless, Marlow, a ma-
chine gun talker, is quick to cut
loose with a volley of PENN-
TAP success stories, Among
them:

—A Connellsville foundry
learned through PENNTAP
that there was a better way to
sand - cast metal. The A&B
Foundry now estimates it is
saving $44,000 per year.

~A_ plastics manufacturer
about to pay $1,000 for a study
was advised by PENNTAP that
the same study had already
been done.

Textile Machine Co. of
Reading had a $30 part on a
knitting machine which failed
frequently and caused ex-
pensive shutdowns. PENNTAP
supplied a 2%-page article
showing a better way to harden
the metal part. None has failed
in two years since.

“This year the total cost of
our program will be $247,000.
We ought to generate two to
three times that budget in sav-
ings,” stated Marlow, who as-
Sociates say spends tax pennies
as if they were dollars of his
own.

In past years, PENNTAP’s
emphasis has been on industry,
and Marlow estimates that 7.8
per cent of the state’s 17,000
companies have benefited.

But the project has been ex-
panded and targets now include
Pennsylvania’s 12,000 munici-
palities.

“T would say that over a peri-
od of time there would not be a

municipality in the state that’

we could not help in some
way,’’ Marlow declared,
“whether it be snow removal,
black-topping, pollution control
or whatever.”

Here’s the way PENNTAP
works:

—Those seeking help can call
any of Penn State’s 23 Contin-
uing Education offices across
the state.

—The office takes the name
of the caller, who is later con-
tacted by one of PENNTAP’s
four fulltime field specialists.

—The field man analyzes the
problems and determine where
to go for the answers.

—“We figure there are about
146 institutions across the state
that can provide all the techni-
cal knowledge that can be
found,” said Marlow.

“We're tied to universities, li-
braries, private laboratories,
companies ~— all the federal
and state, private and public
sources,”he added. “There may
be a font of knowledge that we
don’t know about, but I’d defi-
nitely say we're close to 100 per
cent.’

There have been instances
when certain technology was
not available, Marlow admit-
ted, in which case PENNTAP
suggested the client pay for
new research.

“But at least they knew they
were not using their money to
duplicate research that had al-
ready een done,” Marlow
noted.

“That’s been the problem in
the past. This nation spent $27
billion in research and develop-
ment last year and it's esti-
mated half of it may have been
wasted in duplication.”

PENNTAP gets money from
the state Department of Com-
merce and the National Science
Foundation.

A li-member advisory coun-
cil evaluates the program each
year, as does the Governor’s
Science Advisory Council and
the state Engineering Founda-
tion.

“As far as I know we are the
only state in the nation with 4
technology delivery system like
this,” Marlow said. “President
Nixon is proposing the same
thing nationwide, but we've
been doing it for years,

“The expertise of the nation
is at our fingertips, but people
can’t use it unless they know
about it.”
