Leaders Advocate Pooling of Talents Into Singl
State Looks to Advance ‘

When the National Action
Conference on Inter
governmental Science and
Technology Policy convenes io
Harrisburg Wednesday, one
disturbing fact will be evident:
that the overail record of the
states in mobilizing science
and technology to solve their
domestic problems is not very
impressive.

But the 3-day conference at
the Sheraton Inn, will also see
that a handlul of states, promt
nent among them Pennsylva-
nia, have in many cases out-
distanced the federal govern-
ment in applying science and
technology to human needs.

One of the first Pennsylva-
nians to recognize the need for
domestic technology programs
was Gov. Shapp, who as a pri-
vate citizen in 1982 co-authored
@ major report which calls on
government, industry, and edu-
cation to cooperate in using sci-
ence and technology to stimu-
late the state's sluggish econo-

my.

Since that time, Pennsylva-
nia has been engaged in a pio-
neering effort to find solutiqns
to current and domestic prob-
Jems and to anticipate future
problem areas.

Chief architect of the com-
monwealth’s “Science for
Society’ plan is Dr. Thomas G.
Fox, staff fellow at Pitts
burgh’s Mellon Institute and
professor of chemistry and pol-
ymer science at Carnegie-Mel-
fon University. Since 1965 Dr.
Fox has served as sicence ad-
visor to three governors —
Scranton, Shafer, and Shapp. A
rtcognized leader on the ma-
tional science scene, he ia also
chairman of the National Gov-
ernors Council on Science and
Technology.

According to Fox, the nation
is in a period of transition from
an era of national science (sci-
ence applied to defense and
aerospace) to one of domestic

science (science applied to

problems of environment,
health care, transportation,
housing, etc.).

“This transition is a difficult
one,” he says, ‘‘because the
problems facing acience today
are different in content and
style from those of industrial,
military, or space research. If
we are to succeed in domestic
technology, then we must ex-
plore new approaches, con-
cepts, and partnerships which
can tailor solutions to fit the
often unique needs of @ given
locality.”

Pennsylvania’s leaders be
lieve that one profitable new
approach is to pool the talents
of government, business, and
the academic community into
a single problem-solving effort.
Dr. Fox explains how this part-
nership works:

“State and local govern-
ments are uniquely positioned
to define what problems need
solving, to set in motlon
agencies to help solve them,
and t help stcure funding. In
our universities we find vast
Tepositories for scientific
knowledge, and through our in-
dustries we possess the means
to apply that knowledge. By
bringing together these three
sectors, the vast human and
capital resources already exist-
ing there can be used more el-
fectively to benefit Pennsylva-
nia’s citizens.”

This government-industry-
education partnership is fos-
tered in Pennsylvania by two
seperate but interacting
agencies, the Governor's Sci-
ence Advisory Committee
(GSAC) and the Pennsyivania
Science and Engineering Foun-
dation (PSEF). Both agencies
are headed by the Governor's
Science Advisor and are at-
tached to the state’s Depart:
ment of Commerce through the
Office of Science and Tech-
nology.

Robert D. Laughlin, a career
physicist with a background in
industrial technology devel-
opment for space application,
heads the Office of Science and
Technology. He is quick to
point out that it is not the func-
tion of his office to set science
policy or initiate technical pro-
grams.

“Rather,” be says, “it is our
job to provide staff support for
coordinating and strengthening
the scitnce-oriented activities
of the state government
agencies having the day to day
responsibilty of dealing with
Pennsylvania’s problems. And
through GSAC and PSEF we

have the ability to act as”

catalysts between government,
education, and industry and to
strengthen their abilities to use
science and technology.”

Both GSAC and PSEF exist
to achieve the equally-empha-
sized goais of channeling Penn
sylvania’s scientific and techai-
cal resources into economic
growth and into solutions for
domestic lem areas. To
datt PSEF and GSAC have
concentrated their efforts on
education, environment, trans-
poration, bousing, materials
engineering, health services,
biomedical research and devel-
opment, new cities, informa-
tion transfer, oceanography,
and new techrical fields.
