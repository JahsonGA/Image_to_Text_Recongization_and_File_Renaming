State Looks to Advance “

When the National Action
Conference on Inter
governmental Science and
Technology Policy convenes in
Harrisburg Wednesday, one
disturbing fact will be evident:
that the overall record of the
states in mobilizing science
and technology to solve their
domestic problems is not very
impressive.

But the 3-day conference at
the Sheraton Inn, will also see
that a handful of states, promi-
nent among them Pennsylva-
nia, have in many cases out-
distanced the federal govern-
ment in applying science and
technology to human needs,

‘One of the first Pennsylva-
nians to recognize the need for
domestic technology programs
was Gov. Shapp, who as a pri-
vate citizen in 1962 co-authored
a major report which calls on
government, industry, and edu-
cation to cooperate in using sci-
ence and technology to stimu-
late the state’s sluggish econo-
my.
Since that time, Pennsylva-
nia has been engaged in a pio-
neering effort to find solutions
to current and domestic prob-
Jems and to anticipate future
problem areas.

Chief architect of the com-
monwealth’s ‘Science for
Society’ plan is Dr. Thomas G.
Fox, staff fellow at Pitts-
burgh’s Mellon Institute and
professor of chemistry and pol-
ymer science at Carnegie-Mel-
lon University. Since 1965 Dr.
Fox has served as sicence ad-
visor to three governors —
Scranton, Shafer, and Shapp. A
rtcognized leader on the na-
tional science scene, he is also
chairman of the National Gov-
ernors Council on Science and
Technology.

According to Fox, the nation
is in a period of transition from
an era of national science (sci-
ence applied to defense and
aerospace) to one of domestic

science (science applied. to
problems of environment,
health care, transportation,
housing, etc.).

“This transition is a difficult
one,” he says, ‘because the
problems facing science today
are different in content and
style from those of industrial,
military, or space research. If
we are to succeed in domestic
technology, then we must ex-
plore new approaches, con-
cepts, and partnerships which
can tailor solutions to fit the
often unique needs of a given
locality.”

Pennsylvania’s jeaders be-
lieve that one profitable new
approach is to pool the talents
of government, business, and
the academic , community ‘into
a single problem-solving effort.
Dr. Fox explains how this part-
nership works:

“State and local govern-
ments are uniquely positioned
to define what preblems need
solving, to set in motion
agencies to help solve them,
and to help stcure funding. In
our universities we find vast
repositories for scientific
knowledge, and through our in-
dustries we possess the means
to apply that knowledge. By
bringing together these three
sectors, the vast human and
capital resources already exist-
ing there can be used more ef-
fectively to benefit Pennsylva-
nia’s citizens.”

This  government-industry-
education partnership-is fos-
tered in Pennsylvania by two
seperate but interacting
agencies, the Governor's Sci-
ence Advisory Committee
(GSAC) and the Pennsylvania
Science and Engineering Foun-
dation (PSEF). Both agencies
are headed by the Governor’s
Science Advisor and are at-
tached to the state’s Depart-
ment of Commerce through the
Office of Science and Tech-
nology.

Rabert D. Laughlin, a career
physicist with a background in
industrial technology devel-
opment for space application,
heads the Office of Science and
Technology. He is quick to
point out that it is not the func-
tion of his office to set science
policy or initiate technical pro-
grams.

“Rather,” he says, “it is our
job to provide staff support for
coordinating and strengthening
the scitnce-oriented activities
of the: state government
agencies having the day to day
responsibility of dealing with
Pemmsylvania’s problems, And
through GSAC and PSEF we

have the ability to act as”

catalysts between government,
education, and industry and to
strengthen their abilities to use
science and technology.”

Both GSAC and PSEF exist
to achieve the equally-empha-
sized goals of channeling Penn-
sylvania’s scientific and techni-
cal resources into economic
growth and into solutions for
domestic problem areas. To
datt PSEF and GSAC have
concentrated their efforts on
education, environment, trans-
poration, housing, materials
engineering, health services,
biomedical research and devel-
opment, new cities, informa-
tion transfer, oceanography,
and new technical fields.
