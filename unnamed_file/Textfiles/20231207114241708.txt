Connellsville
Foundryman

The theory that a tittle khowl-
édge Is a dangerous thirig goes
awry as far as a Connellsville
foundryman Is concerned. As a
newly promoted general manager
of the New A & B Fouridry, Inc.,
Charles M, Davis knew he didn’t
have all the answers. and decided.
to attend a Pennsylvania Technl-
cal Assistance Program (PENN:
TAP) workshop: on sand casting.
AS. a result, his foundry is realiz~
ing an estimated yearly saving
of $44,000.

The reason. Changes institited
by the foundry in sand controt,
gleaned ftom. the workshop, éf-
fected: a 300 percent improvement:
on casting surface finishes — vir-

tually eliminating. scrap due to-

sand related. causes.

In. addition: to the direct fabor
costs, Davis feels that the foundry,
which has gross shipments of be-
tween: $300,000: and $400,000, can:
also. claim a real saving of ap-
proximately $23,000 due to re+
duced. overhead.

A producer of high. quality non-
ferrous. sand castings for various:
types. of industry, the foundry pro-
duces castings which vary In
weight from a few ounces to 200
pounds.

Because considerable skill is
Tequired In gating and feeding
the castings, as well as: in con-
stant checks on sand conditions
and metal controls, Davis and his:
sand technician (now plarit fore-
man}, George E. Timko, Sr., wert
to the Workshop Seminars on
Sand Testing Techniques for
Penrisylvania Foundrymen in Pitts-
burgh simply bécause they: néed-
ed expanded knowledge.
wanted to know how to use data
they had obtained from in-plant
testing, arid what effects additives,
had on sand.

Under the direction of Wesley:
Winter, associate professor of In-
dustrial engineering, The Pennsyl+
vania State University, the two
mien learned how to properly con-
duct sand: testing.

knowledge,” said Davis, “these
well recognized individuals in
their fields filled in the gaps that
existed in our minds, allowing us
to come up with answers:on what
to do. We came away from the:
workshop with a new coripacti-
bility test and a thorough know!-
edge for interpreting test results
with: corrective action.”

Prior to the workstiop, the foun-
dry was running between ten and
thirteen percerit scrap due to all
conditions, but sifice the change
over, this figure dropped to be-
tween. three and five percent. Of
this lower percentage, five per-
cent represents sand casting de-
fects — surface defects, scabs,
buckles, rat tails, surface rough-
ness, veining, and blow holes.

Foundry became. a full tinie oper-.
ation: in the early sixties and was
incorporated. in 1965. In January
1971, the foundry became a sub-
sidiary of The Duraioy Company,
