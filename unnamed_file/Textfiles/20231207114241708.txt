Connellsville
Foundryman

The theory that a little knowt-
edge Is a dangerous thing goes
awry as fas as a Connellsville
foundryman Is concerned. As a
newly promoted general manager
of the New A & B Foundry, Inc.,
Charies M. Davis knew he didn't
have all the answers and decided
to attend a Pennsylvania Techni-
cal Assistance Program (PENN-
TAP) workshop on sand casting.
As a result, his foundry is realiz-
Ing an estimated yearly saving
of $44,000.

The reason. Changes Iretituted
by the foundry in sand controf,
gleaned from the workshop, ef-
fected a 300 percent improvement
on casting surface finishes — vir-

tually eliminating scrap due to.

sand related causes.

In addition to the direct labor
costs, Davis feels that the foundry,
which has gross shipments of be-
tween $300,000 and $400,000, can
also claim a real saving of ap-
proximately $23,000 due to re
duced overhead.

A producer of high quality non-
ferrous sand castings for various
types of industry, the foundry pro-
duces castings which vary In
welght from a few ounces to 200
pounds.

Because considerable skill is
required In gating and feeding
the castings, as well as In con-
stant checks on sand conditions
and metal controfs, Davis and his
sand techniclan (now plant fore-
man), George E. Timko, Sr., went
to the Workshop Seminars on
Sand Testing Techniques for
Pennsyivanta Foundrymen In Pitts-
burgh simply because they need-

ed expanded knowledge. They’

wanted to know how to use date
they had obtained from in-plant
testing, and what effects additives
had on sand.

Under the direction of Wesley
Winter, associate professor of In-
dustrial engineering, The Pennsyt-
vanla Stata University, the two
men learned how to property con-
duct sand testing.

knowtedge," said Davis, ‘these
well recognized individuals in
their flelds filled in the gaps that
existed in our minds, allowing us
to come up with answers on what
to do. We came away from the
workshop with a new compacti-
bility test and a thorough knowl-
edge for interpreting test results
with corrective action.”

Prior to the workshop, the foun-
dry was running between ten and
thirteen percent scrap due to alt
conditions, but since the change
over, this figure dropped to be-
tween three and five percent. Of
this lower percentage, five per-
cent represents sand casting de-
fects — surface defects, scabs,
buckles, rat talis, surface rough-
ness, veining, and blow holes.

Started In 1958 as a part time
experimental foundry by Davis’
father, |. Cilfford, to provide com-
mercially unavallable dies for his
pattern shop, the New A & B
Foundry became a full time oper-
ation in the early sixtles and was
incorporated In 1965. In January
1971, the foundry became a sub-
sidlary of The Duraloy Company,
Scottdale, an alloy-steel producer.

Davis, an industrial engineer,
jolned the foundry fotiowing his
graduation from The Pennsylvania
State University In June 1969.
Assisted by his brother, George
C., plant manager, Davis oversees
the operation which employs ap-

proximately 20 peopte and has a
physical pliant of 7,600 square
feet.

Approximately 30 percent of the
foundry's products are aluminum
castings sold commercially, while
65 percent are brass and bronze
castings manufactured for com-
mercial and nuclear applications.
The remaining five percent are
sold as dies, molds, and specialty
Items. Some of the foundry’s cua-
tomers are manvfacturers of new
and replacement parts for the
coal mining industry, original
equipment castings for manufac-
turers of pumps, vaives, ctean-
Ing, and marking equipment. Die
work is also done for fabricators
of sheet metal for aircraft, and
molds for the plastic and rubber
Industry.

This successtyl application of
existing technology to existing In-
dustrial problems was net a coln-
cldence. Realizing that every
such organization must have ac-
cess to, be abie to Interpret, and
be able to apply the latest Infor-
mation if it Is to operate success-
fully, PENNTAP, administered as
a continuing education program
of The Pennsyivania State Univer-
sity, extends its services to those
in the Commonwealth who can
apply sclentific and technical In-
formation to solve existing prob-
lems, not only for economic but
for social benefit.

PENNTAP exists to deliver cur-
tent technology through a nyrm-
ber of projects. Projects for the

current year Inciude selected
workshops and short courses; the
Library Information System to pro-
vide written possible solutions to
existing problems; the Sound of
Progress radio broadcast to
create a greater awareness; an
audio visual tape library; and the

‘ work of technically qualified fleld

specialists to aid the user In de-
fining and solving his problems.
Each of the 23 Continuing Edu-
cation offices of The Pennsylvania
State University throughout the
Commonwealth serves as a “re-
celving station.” A person desir-
Ing the benefits from PENNTAP’s
many projects should call or write
the nearest Penn State Continu-
Ing Education office and request
PENNTAP's assistance.
