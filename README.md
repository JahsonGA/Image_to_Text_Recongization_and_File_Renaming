# Image_to_Text_Recongization_and_File_Renaming
This program will take an TIFF image stored in a folder and read the text from it and gather important information to rename the file. 

Ideas:
  using CV and OCR to gather all text 
    if the image cannot be read then place it on a folder for manual review
  using the text, find the date publisher and title of the article/image. 
  rename the file in the order of title publisher and then date. 
  create a table with the information to be exported to excel.
